Some unit test are expected to fail if the code under test is working correctly (e.g.
a macro that fails if a property passes, must fail when evaluated with '1'). Hence the
output of SVUnit is misleading for those tests.  Use

    test.sh
    
for this. No output means that everything is working as expected.
